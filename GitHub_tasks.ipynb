      "\n",
      "@dhh initiated with #50446 the work to introduce basic authentication on Rails and closed the issue through #52328 providing basic session management. \n",
      "\n",
      "Right now, among others, there are three widely used solutions for auth on Rails with 400m lifetime downloads: \n",
      "\n",
      "* Devise has seen no significant development in years (227 million downloads) with @nashby doing a great job merging security issues, but the gem itself seems to be unmaintained;\n",
      "* Omniauth is doing much better due to @BobbyMcWho but provides oauth strategies only;\n",
      "* Pundit sponsored by Varvet and maintained by @burgestrand to provide basic auth. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think the download numbers of the above gems show that we largely rely on single individuals rolling entire auth stacks for the most of the community. I am sure if anybody would look realistically into this with a risk analysis nobody really understands what's happening inside devise, omniauth or Pundit apart from the maintainers themselves right now and this is bad (I do not want in any way to diminish their effort, it's just unhealthy for the ecosystem). I think this is a dire situation and ticking time bomb, Devise has not seen contributions by the chief maintainers for some while now and the general assumption seems to be anybody can do auth, my (very personal) opinion is, that this is not the case. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let's for a moment assume that best practice would be this:\n",
      "\n",
      "* auth is not written / maintained by a single developer (not given at Omniauth / Pundit);\n",
      "* a team of skilled people with appropriate seniority review PRs individually;\n",
      "* nobody suffers through touching fundamentals of encryption.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not believe that most teams meet those requirements and believe that the fact that rails, different to other major frameworks, does not have an either strongly sponsored (nextauthjs) or core team maintained (Laravel / Python) solution for this is a systemic risk.\n",
      "\n",
